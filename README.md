# Mega Growth Engineer Homework

Our code challenge for growth engineering applicants. Please fork this repo and push onto the forked repo

## Project

The project consists of two parts Frontend and Backend

# Frontend

We would like you to build a web page that displays top 10 leaderboard of facebook profiles which has the maximum number of friends in their friends list.

The user must be prompted to signin with facebook before the user can see the leaderboard of profiles. Make sure each user is unique and upon subsequent signups the profile is not repeated

Users should have a good user experience on desktop, tablet and mobile devices.

# Backend

We would like you to store the relevant data required for the UI. You can use firebase or any database of your choice to store the data.

Create an API to get the leaderboard data from the database and send relevant information back to the client

This project is pretty open ended in order to leave you some freedom to improve upon the base by focusing on what you like the most.

One of the top priorities for a growth engineer at GetMega is to be able to quickly come up with a solution and later on iterate on the same so you can start of with a very basic version and then can iterate on it as you get time.

### Project Structure

You can use [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) to start of your boilerplate for the frontend. On the backend side feel free to use any language of your choice

### Submission Instructions

Via Email: Please send us a link to a public Github repo of your solution code base. Do not send an attachment. 

### Evaluation

The app should be hosted on a website and should run without crashing or any issues. Please make sure you cover the edge cases and also the error handling for the same
